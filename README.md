Zenith is a mod about adding additional layers of content to vanilla systems. It doesn't add much in the way of blocks or items, but it adds a significant amount of content. It's divided into modules, each separate from another. Any module can be disabled at will, but all the modules work best when they are all enabled.

Zenith is an unofficial fabric port of Apotheosis. The forge version can be found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis).
